## 0.6.0 Release

### New Features

  - sort and dedup output of --verbose --crates.

### Fixes

  - Upgrade to 2021 edition and update dependencies to latest levels.
  - This resolves the warning 'the following packages contain code that will be
    rejected by a future version of Rust: syn v0.14.2
  - Replace problematic json crate (causing errors as from 0.12) with serde_json
  - Issue #13 set DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH for dynamic execution
  - Isssue #5 respect \n in --prepend text, and add an extra \n to be sure
  - Fix printing of dependencies in output of --verbose --crates <crate>
  - Implement clippy::pedantic suggestions
  - Fix minor typos in README and update JSON example, also make the example match.
  - Fix r4 demo in README
  - Fix version reporting (use CARGO_PKG_VERSION)
  - TODO Fix running program in another dir - or not? Works fine if not hard-coded in program, like filetime.rs
  - Fixed: tolerate --static on --run for files compiled dynamically. When this combination is specified, a
    best effort will be made to run statically, but the DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH will be set to prevent likely
    problems with dynamic loading in case the program was compiled dynamically.
  - TODO option to clean out saved artifacts?
  - Fix issue #9 running from stdin, except currently code will be saved.
    TODO: tweak behaviour
  - Display whether current action is static or dynamic
  - TODO Test --compile-only with all "expression = true" options.
  - Change regex example to include libc, do other new or changed examples. E.g. the time one and the "bonzo dog" changes.

## 0.5.0 Release

### New Features

  - `--run` re-run without re-compilation
  - `--add` if crate already present, not an error. Will run available program (Issue #7)
  - `--simplify` for *not* simplifying error messages, which now happens by default
    (`std::string::String` becomes just `String`)
  - `args` available to snippets
  - `--crates` output is in same format as `[dependencies]` section of Cargo.toml
  - `--crates` with `--verbose` shows dependency tree
  - Arg comments now start with '//: ' and can appear in source file
  - `Duration` and `thread` added to prelude

### Fixes

  - Sometimes Windows standalone installer does not create Cargo bin dir
  - Detect 'unstable' using 'nightly'
  - Do not force rustc colours if not outputing to a terminal
  - Issue #9 (use basename) and ensure non-zero status code on failure

## 0.3.0 Release

### New Features

  - `--prepend` inserts code into body for -e, -i and -n
  - `--extern` also used for explicitly linking to a crate
  - `--features` shortcut for specifying features when compiling
  - `--compile-only` copies file to current dir after compilation
  - `--no-prelude` prevent usual runner prelude from being included
  - "$VAR" environment expansions for -e, -i and -n
  - `--doc` can be given a crate name

### Fixes

  - distinction between project and crate names
