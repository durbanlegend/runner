## 0.5.0 Release

### New Features

  - `--run` re-run without re-compilation
  - `--add` if crate already present, not an error. Will run available program (Issue #7)
  - `--simplify` for *not* simplifying error messages, which now happens by default
    (`std::string::String` becomes just `String`)
  - `args` available to snippets
  - `--crates` output is in same format as `[dependencies]` section of Cargo.toml
  - `--crates` with `--verbose` shows dependency tree
  - Arg comments now start with '//: ' and can appear in source file
  - `Duration` and `thread` added to prelude

### Fixes

  - Sometimes Windows standalone installer does not create Cargo bin dir
  - Detect 'unstable' using 'nightly'
  - Do not force rustc colours if not outputing to a terminal
  - Issue #9 (use basename) and ensure non-zero status code on failure

  - `--no-prelude` prevent usual runner prelude from being included
  - "$VAR" environment expansions for -e, -i and -n
